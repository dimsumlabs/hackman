  <h2>Payment Claim Recorded</h2>

  {% if valid_until %}
  <p>The door's database now says your dues are paid until {{ valid_until }}
  {% endif %}

  <h3>If you have had an issue with the door:</h3>

  <p> We are sorry that the database the door is using was incorrect.  It is
  important that you let us know what is wrong so that we can investigate
  and fix any issues.

  <ul>
    <li> Write your name and today's date on a sheet of paper.
    <li> Write a quick note of what was wrong (ie: "I paid with paypal on the
    27th of the month, but the door would not let me in today")
    <li> Insert this paper into the locked donations tin mounted on the wall.
  </ul>

  <p> Failure to follow these steps may result in your account being
  locked out.  Misuse of the payment claim system will result in your
  account being locked out.

  <h3>If you are paying your Membership now:</h3>

  <p> If you could not enter because your membership is due and you are
  now entering the space to pay your membership, follow the normal payment
  process written up on the wall.

  <p> Summarised, this is:

  <ul>
    <li> Write your name and today's date on an envelope.
    <li> Place your payment inside the envelope.
    <li> Insert this envelope into the locked donations tin mounted on the wall.
  </ul>

  <p> It may take a couple of days for someone to manually collect your
  envelope and update the master database.

  <p> You may open the door within the next 1 minute.
